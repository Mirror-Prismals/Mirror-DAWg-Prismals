# Mirror-DAWg-Prismals

#### I made you a DAW! it's not very good, sorry!...

this repository contains:
over 400 standalone “apps “, 
3 different "voxel games", 
4 different "digital audio workstations", 
and 1 "alternate reality game."

If you have never run python code or C++ code or if you don’t have the jack audio server  (qjackctl) or if you are unfamiliar with installing Python packages learn how to do that first and then come back here.

Mirror is the world’s first fully fledged, digital audio workstation  hybrid with a voxel game, today we are releasing mirror pre-Alpha, a collection of over 126,000 lines of code that you can use to make your own digital audio workstations, voxel games, art apps, and the like. The license is very permissive, allowing you to make educational and nonprofit closed source derivatives without worrying about other people making similar derivatives and squashing all of your fun with a patent claim. We hope to bring upon a new era of digital audio workstations that you actually own. We hope everyone starts to share and develop their own mirrors.

if you would like to distribute a some form of the source code that you modified with your own proprietary modifications, you can purchase non-exclusive lifetime license to distribute for $19 under the terms of the smiling license. Please email midabanker@proton.me and I will correspond. you are otherwise free to fork and share this code for non-commercial, educational or personally private use.
