![](https://github.com/Mirror-Prismals/Mirror-DAWg-Prismals/blob/main/readme_assets/readme_assets__mirror_thumbnail.png)
#### I made you a DAW! it's not very good, sorry!...
---
this repository contains:
over 400 standalone “apps “, 
3 different "voxel games", 
4 different "digital audio workstations", 
and 1 "alternate reality game."

> If you have never run python code or C++ code or if you don’t have the jack audio server  (qjackctl) or if you are unfamiliar with installing Python packages... learn how to do that first and then come back here. It would also be good to install a virtual audio cable like VB cable.

## Mirror 
### is the world’s first fully fledged, digital audio workstation hybrid with a voxel game.

Today we are releasing mirror pre-Alpha, a collection of over 126,000 lines of code that you can use to make your own digital audio workstations, voxel games, art apps, and the like. 

The license is very permissive, allowing you to make educational and nonprofit closed source derivatives as well as closed source for-profit forks (if you pay a small one time fee) without worrying about other people making similar derivatives and squashing all of your fun with an unjust legal claim. We hope to bring upon a new era of digital audio workstations that you actually own. We hope everyone starts to share and develop their own mirrors.

###### if you would like to distribute commercialzed forks- for selling some form of the source code that you modified with your own proprietary modifications, you can purchase non-exclusive lifetime license to distribute for $19 under the terms of the smiling license. Please email midabanker@proton.me and I will correspond. you are otherwise free to fork and share and redistribute this code for non-commercial, educational or personally private use, or sharing with friends and online communities, in source or binary form.
